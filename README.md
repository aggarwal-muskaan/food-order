# order-munchiesðŸŒ®

This is a project from the Udemy course by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller.  
It is a food delivery app that provides menu and takes user details.  
The styles are completely copied from the course.

## Takeaway for Me

1. **Firebase** : The realtime database for fetching meals & storing user information.
2. **CSS Modules** : It's like `.css` file only but styles are scoped to a particular component.  
   [Read more about CSS Modules](https://medium.com/@ralph1786/using-css-modules-in-react-app-c2079eadbb87)
3. **ForwardRefs** : I've learnt where to use Refs. [Click here](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) to know.
4. **Portals** : Before learning how to create one, I've always used third-party components for _overlays_.  
   It really important to know where do we need [Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html).
5. **Fragment Tags** : We must use it more often to save our DOM from irrelevant nodes.ðŸ˜‰

## Form-Validation

I've used [Formik](https://formik.org/) for validating user information while checkout.
